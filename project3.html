     <h1>Built an Android social media app using Kotlin with Node.js for the backend
          and Mongo DB as the database</h1>

          <li><a href="https://github.com/chege4179/blogger">Source code</a></li>
     </ul>
     <p>
          This is a native android application built with jetpack compose (Modern Android UI library)
          The app is available for download here for now but I will upload it to the play store soon
          The backend application is built on node.js with the express.js framework to store and retrieve information of the application.The database used is Mongo DB

          The backend is deployed on heroku and the code is on a private github repository
          PS (You will find the deployed API endpoint in the source code so the code should run smoothly)
