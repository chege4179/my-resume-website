                I built a school management system for St. Therese vocational training centre to keep record of
                the students and teachers in the institution. The system is built with Next.js for the frontend and
                Express.js (Node.js) for the backend and it uses MySQL as the primary database
            </p>

            <p>
                Some of the features of the system include :
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Storage of student information with full CRUD functionality </li>
                <li>Tracking of fees information for all students depending on their course</li>
            </ul>
